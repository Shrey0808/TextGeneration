# Project Description: Text Generation using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

## Abstract:
This project focuses on implementing a Text Generation model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. The model is trained on a given text dataset and is capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text. The project covers key aspects such as model architecture, training, and text generation using the trained RNN.

## 1. Introduction:
Text generation is a fascinating application of deep learning, and this project explores the use of an RNN with LSTM units for generating text. The model learns patterns and structures from the input text data and can then generate new sequences of text that resemble the training data.

## 2. Model Architecture:
The implemented model is a Character-level RNN with an embedding layer, LSTM layers, and a fully connected layer for output. The model is trained to predict the next character in a sequence based on the preceding characters. This architecture allows the model to capture dependencies and context in the text data.

## 3. Data Preprocessing:
The input text is preprocessed to identify unique characters, mapping them to indices, and creating input-target pairs for training. This preprocessing step is crucial for converting raw text into a format suitable for training deep learning models.

## 4. Training Phase:
The model is trained using a specified sequence length, hidden size, and number of LSTM layers. The training loop updaties the model parameters to minimize the cross-entropy loss. The training loss is monitored to assess model convergence.

## 5. Text Generation:
After training, the model is capable of generating text by providing an initial seed sequence. The generated text is a creative output based on the learned patterns and structures from the training data.

## 6. Results:
The trained model demonstrates the ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. The training loss decreases over epochs, indicating the model's learning and adaptation to the provided text dataset.

## 7. Future Work:
Future enhancements may involve experimenting with different hyperparameters, exploring more complex architectures, and incorporating attention mechanisms for improved context understanding in text generation.

## 8. Conclusion:
This project implements a Text Generation model using RNNs. It can be used for creative writing, storytelling, and generating text in various domains one trained over the desired datasets in the same format
